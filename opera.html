                <p>
                        And now that everybody has gone, and we're happily
                    and comfortably married, I want to have a few words with my
                    new-born husband.
                </p>
            <h5>LUD.</h5> 
                <p>(aside).</p>  
                <p>
                        Yes, I expect you'll often have a few words
                    with your new-born husband! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Aloud.)
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Well, what is it?
                </p>
            <h5>JULIA.</h5>  
                <p>
                        Why, I've been thinking that as you and I have to
                    play our parts for life, it is most essential that we should come
                    to a definite understanding as to how they shall be rendered.
                    Now, I've been considering how I can make the most of the Grand
                    Duchess.
                </p>
            <h5>LUD.</h5> 
                <p>
                    Have you?  Well, if you'll take my advice, you'll make a very fine part of it.
                </p>
                    
            <h5>JULIA.</h5>  
                <p>
                    Why, that's quite my idea.
                </p>
            <h5>LUD.</h5>  
                <p>
                     I shouldn't make it one of your hoity-toity vixenish
                    viragoes.
                </p>
           
            <h5>JULIA.</h5>  
                <p>
                    You think not?
