                        And now that everybody has gone, and we're happily
                    and comfortably married, I want to have a few words with my
                    new-born husband.

                        Why, I've been thinking that as you and I have to
                    play our parts for life, it is most essential that we should come
                    to a definite understanding as to how they shall be rendered.
                    Now, I've been considering how I can make the most of the Grand
                    Duchess.
