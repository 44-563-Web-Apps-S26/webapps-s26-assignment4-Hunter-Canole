            JULIA.  And now that everybody has gone, and we're happily
            and comfortably married, I want to have a few words with my
            new-born husband.
            LUD. (aside).  Yes, I expect you'll often have a few words
            with your new-born husband!  (Aloud.)  Well, what is it?
            JULIA.  Why, I've been thinking that as you and I have to
            play our parts for life, it is most essential that we should come
            to a definite understanding as to how they shall be rendered.
            Now, I've been considering how I can make the most of the Grand
            Duchess.
            LUD.  Have you?  Well, if you'll take my advice, you'll
            make
            a very fine part of it.
            JULIA.  Why, that's quite my idea.
            LUD.  I shouldn't make it one of your hoity-toity vixenish
            viragoes.
            JULIA.  You think not?
        </P>
